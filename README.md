# Analyzing Pricing and Discount Strategies

This project focuses on analyzing discount pricing strategies across various mobile phone brands and price segments. By leveraging a dataset containing details about mobile phones (such as actual price, discount price, ratings, reviews, and specifications), the analysis aims to uncover patterns in discount behavior, assess brand performance in discounting, and explore how different price segments affect pricing strategies.

## Key Objectives:
- **Identify discount patterns** across different price segments.
- **Investigate discount levels** used by various brands.
- **Analyze the impact** of price segmentation on discount strategies.
- **Provide actionable insights** for optimizing pricing and discount strategies to influence consumer behavior.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- `plotly` for interactive visualizations.

The insights from this analysis can help brands improve their pricing strategies and better align their discounting policies with consumer expectations.
